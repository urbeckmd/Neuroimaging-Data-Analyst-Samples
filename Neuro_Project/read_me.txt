PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This project uses a Keras CNN object classifier to identify whether someone's eyes are opened or closed. 

FILES: There are two files present in this project: image_collection.py , eye_object_classifier.py

IMAGE_COLLECTION.PY: This script uses the webcam to collect and organize images of opened and closed eyes that the CNN model will be trained on.

EYE_OBJECT_CLASSIFIER.PY: This script builds and trains a Keras CNN that can identify images of opened eyes or closed eyes.
